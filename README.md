# Shell-Scripting

This repository is a collection of three shell scripts written to accomplish the following tasks:

  1. add_to_trash: This script creates a trash directory in user's home directory. The file specified in the prompt is moved to this directory. This script superseded the rm utility.
  2. backup: This script creates a compressed archived backup and moves it to the backup directory.
  3. remove_spaces: This script removes spaces from the filenames and replaces them with hyphens.
